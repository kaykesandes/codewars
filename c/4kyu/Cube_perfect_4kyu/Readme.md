# Sums of Perfect Squares

The task is simply stated. Given an integer `n` `(3 < n < 109)`, find the length of the smallest list of perfect squares which add up to `n`. Come up with the best algorithm you can; you'll need it!

## __Examples:__

<ul>
    <li> sum_of_squares(17) = 2 <br>17 = 16 + 1 (16 and 1 are perfect squares).</li>
    <li> sum_of_squares(15) = 4 <br> 15 = 9 + 4 + 1 + 1. There is no way to represent 15 as the sum of three perfect squares.</li>
    <li> sum_of_squares(16) = 1 <br> 16 itself is a perfect square.</li>
</ul>

## __Time constraints:__

5 easy (sample) test cases: `n < 20`

5 harder test cases: `1000 < n < 15000`

5 maximally hard test cases: `5e8 < n < 1e9`

100 random maximally hard test cases: `1e8 < n < 1e9`
